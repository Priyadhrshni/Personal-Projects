Thedosage of digoxin may need to be adjusted by 30% to 50% or its frequency ofadministration adjusted if quinidine is initiated or discontinued.  Considertherapy with an agent which has not been shown to interact with digoxin.<P><B class=\"DISC\">DISCUSSION:</B>  In a study of six subjects, quinidine sulfate (300 mg every 6hours) was given orally for 3 days prior to an injection of digoxin (1 mg)and then continued for 5 more days.  Systemic clearance of digoxin wasreduced by 45%, the renal clearance reduced by 33%, and the nonrenalclearance reduced by 60% with all values being statistically significant.   In another study of 101 subjects receiving digoxin alone and 20 subjectsreceiving digoxin and quinidine together, the addition of quinidine wasfound to decrease digoxin clearance by 26%.  In addition, 10 of the 20subjects (50%) receiving digoxin and quinidine together were confirmed tohave digitalis toxicity, whereas only 5 of the 101 subjects (4.9%) receivingdigoxin alone were confirmed to have digitalis toxicity. The authorsconcluded that quinidine caused an increase in digoxin toxicity even in thetherapeutic serum digoxin levels(2).   In a clinical pharmacokinetic in vitro study, a portion of the jejunumwas taken from seven healthy subjects with a multilumen perfusion catheter.A portion of the jejunal segment was added with digoxin alone while anotherportion had administered digoxin with quinidine. The results indicated thatwhen digoxin was added alone 22.3%(+/-8.9%) was absorbed; the addition ofquinidine to the jejunal segment caused an increase in the fraction ofabsorbed digoxin by 55.8%(+/-21.2%)(p<0.05). Also, the Cmax for digoxinalone was 1.0ng/ml/mg(+/-0.4) while digoxin administered with quinidinecaused a Cmax increase to 3.8ng/ml/mg(+/-1.2) (P<0.001)(3).   Concomitant administration of quinidine and digoxin increased the digoxinserum concentration 100%.

Although the influence of spironolactone on digoxin's pharmacodynamiceffects has not been as extensively evaluated as its pharmacokineticeffects, in two studies the inotropic action of digoxin was reduced duringspironolactone administration as measured by preejection period index.However, one study reported that in patients for whom potassium depletionmay lead to digoxin toxicity, a potassium-sparing diuretic may safely beused to reduce potassium excretion and thereby reduce the risk ofarrhythmias.   Spironolactone has been reported to interfere with some digoxin assays.   Concomitant administration of spironolactone and digoxin increased thedigoxin serum concentration 25%.

The dosage of digitalisglycoside may need to be decreased by 30-50% or the frequency ofadministration may be reduced.<P><B class=\"DISC\">DISCUSSION:</B>  In a retrospective review, azithromycin, clarithromycin, anderythromycin use were associated with a 3.7-fold, 7.9-fold, and 3.7-foldincreased risk of digoxin toxicity.(1)   In a retrospective review, clarithromycin prescription at 7, 14, and 30days prior was associated with a 4.36-fold, 5.07-fold, and 2.98-foldincrease in risk of hospitalization for digoxin toxicity.(2)   In a clinical trial in 12 healthy males, clarithromycin (250 mg twicedaily for 3 days) increased the area-under-curve (AUC) of a single oral doseof digoxin by 1.7-fold.  Clarithromycin increased the AUC of intravenousdigoxin by 1.2-fold.(3)   In a study in 7 patients with congestive heart failure, clarithromycintherapy increased digoxin levels by 70%.(4)   In a study in elderly patients taking digoxin, clarithromycin decreaseddigoxin renal clearance by 56-60%.(5)   In a study in 9 healthy males, clarithromycin and erythromycin had noeffect on levels of intravenous digoxin.(6)   In a study in 3 subjects, erythromycin increased serum digoxinconcentrations 2-fold.(7)   Telithromycin has been shown to increase digoxin maximum concentration(Cmax) and trough levels (Cmin) by 73% and 21%, respectively.(8)   Elevated digoxin levels and toxicity have been reported during concurrenttherapy with azithromycin,(9) clarithromycin,(10-25) erythromycin,(26-30)josamycin,(31) roxithromycin,(32) and telithromycin.(33)   Approximately 10% of the patients receiving digoxin excrete significantamounts of inactive digoxin metabolites.(7)  Since bacterial flora in the GItract are involved with the conversion of cardioactive digoxin to theinactive metabolite, administration of macrolides as well as otherantibiotics may alter the bacterial flora, interfering with the conversionprocess.  These 10% of the patients are at additional risk of elevateddigoxin levels due to the drug interaction.
